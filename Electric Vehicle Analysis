# 🚗 Electric Vehicle Analysis

An interactive Power BI dashboard project analyzing electric vehicle (EV) data from Washington state to derive meaningful insights about EV distribution, types, utility associations, and market trends.

---

## 📌 Summary

This project utilizes **Power BI** to visualize and analyze EV adoption trends using a dataset of over 133,000 records. 
The analysis focuses on vehicle types, makes, models, electric range, utility providers, and state-level distributions to support data-driven decisions for clean energy policies and EV infrastructure planning.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To build an insightful, dynamic, and user-interactive Power BI dashboard that:
- Analyzes EV adoption trends across various dimensions.
- Identifies key players (makes, models) in the EV space.
- Assesses the popularity and growth of BEVs and PHEVs.
- Assists policymakers and utility providers in planning infrastructure.

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: [Electric Vehicle Population Data]
- **Total Rows**: 133,104  
- **Total Columns**: 17  
- **Format**: CSV  
- **Key Features**:
  - `Vehicle ID`, `Make`, `Model`, `Electric Range`, `Electric Vehicle Type`
  - `Model Year`, `City`, `State`, `Electric Utility`, `CAFV Eligibility`

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

With the rise in electric vehicle usage, how can we:
- Quantify and visualize EV adoption across different regions?
- Compare BEV vs. PHEV usage trends?
- Understand how utility providers and model years influence adoption?
- Inform future infrastructure and energy distribution plans?

## 📈 KPIs and Custom Measures

Custom DAX Measures:
- **BEV Vehicles**  
- **PHEV Vehicles**  
- **Total Vehicles**  
- **% of BEV** = [BEV Vehicles] / [Total Vehicles]  
- **% of PHEV** = [PHEV Vehicles] / [Total Vehicles]  

KPIs Displayed:
- **Total Vehicles**
- **Average Electric Range**

## 📈 KPIs & DAX Measures

| KPI Name           | DAX Formula |
|--------------------|-------------|
| % of BEV           | `% of BEV = [BEV Vehicles] / [Total Vehicles]` |
| % of PHEV          | `% of PHEV = [PHEV Vehicles] / [Total Vehicles]` |
| BEV Vehicles       | `BEV Vehicles = CALCULATE([Total Vehicles],Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data[Electric Vehicle Type] = "Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)")` |
| PHEV Vehicles      | `PHEV Vehicles = CALCULATE([Total Vehicles],Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data[Electric Vehicle Type] = "Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)")` |
| Total Vehicles     | `Total Vehicles = DISTINCTCOUNT(Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data[DOL Vehicle ID])` |

## 🧠 Analysis & Key Findings

- **Tesla**, **Nissan**, and **Chevrolet** dominate the EV market in Washington.
- Majority of vehicles are **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)**.
- There is a consistent growth in **electric vehicle adoption** from 2010 to present.
- Certain utilities and cities show higher concentration, indicating infrastructure readiness.
- A substantial portion of vehicles are **CAFV eligible**, aligning with clean energy goals.

---

## 📌 Inference & Decisions

- The adoption rate shows strong correlation with newer model years and CAFV eligibility.
- Insights from the dashboard can help identify **target regions** for EV infrastructure expansion.
- The **type of EV** (BEV vs. PHEV) is useful for predicting **charging needs** and **energy demand**.

---

## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps

- Handled null/missing values during data loading.
- Created distinct counts for accurate vehicle representation.
- Applied DAX to build custom aggregations and KPIs.
- Visual formatting and data filtering for user experience.

---

## 📍 Insights

- BEVs make up the majority of total EVs (~X%).
- Urban areas show denser EV populations.
- Year-over-year growth patterns indicate rising adoption trends.

---

## 📌 Conclusion

The dashboard delivers a clear, real-time view of electric vehicle trends that can empower:
- **Government bodies** for policy making
- **Utility companies** for infrastructure planning
- **Automotive players** to understand market competition
